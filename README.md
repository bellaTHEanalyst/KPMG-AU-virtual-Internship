## Background Information

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd (fictional company), a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organization based in Australia.

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organization has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyze it to help optimize its marketing strategy.

Here is my task:

Draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues. Refer to ‘Data Quality Framework Table’ and resources below for criteria and dimensions which you should consider.

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:
- Customer Demographic

This is a project from my KPMG data analytics virtual internship program where work as a Data Analyst to performed three tasks:

Data Quality Assessment: Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis.

**Data Quality Assessment**

During this task, assessment of data quality and completeness was done on the three (3) datasets and recommendations are provided in preparation for analysis using Excel Spreadsheet.
